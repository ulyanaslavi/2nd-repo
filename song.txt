Let's dance in style,
Let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait,
We're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best
But expecting the worst
Are you going to drop the bomb or not????
Let us die young or
let us live forever
We don't have the power
But we never say never


Sitting in a sandpit,
Life is a short trip
The music's for the sad men
Can you imagine when this race is won?


Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders,
We're getting in tune
The music's played by the madmen

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever -- and ever


just for tag
